            <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
            <p>We collect only essential business information, including GST number (if applicable), business address, phone number, and transaction history. This data is used solely to facilitate B2B trade, verify seller and buyer identities, and optimize hyper-local delivery routing.</p>
            
            <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
            <p>We do not sell your personal or business data to third parties. Buyer contact information is shared directly with the selected Seller only when an order is placed to allow for direct negotiation and delivery coordination. Logistics data (address, pin code, time slot) is shared with our local delivery partners.</p>
            
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>We employ standard encryption methods to protect your passwords and ledger data. However, as credit relies on the trust between Buyer and Seller, please ensure secure password practices.</p>
