            <h2>Seller Service Level Agreement (SLA)</h2>
            <p>This agreement outlines the responsibilities of Sellers using the Bhubaneswar Connect platform to ensure high quality service for local buyers.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Inventory Accuracy</h3>
            <p>Sellers agree to maintain 95% accuracy on stock levels displayed online. Any order cancellation due to insufficient stock must be communicated to the Buyer within 2 hours of confirmation.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Pricing Integrity</h3>
            <p>Prices listed must be the final wholesale price. No hidden fees are allowed. Any changes resulting from an RFQ must be recorded and honored.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>In the event of a dispute, both Seller and Buyer agree to first attempt resolution directly. Bhubaneswar Connect will only intervene to provide transaction logs and communication records.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 30px; font-style: italic;">By registering, you agree to abide by this SLA.</p>
